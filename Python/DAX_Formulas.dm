## Basic Match Metrics

### TotalG - Total Goals in Match
```dax
TotalG = '14-20'[G1] + '14-20'[G2]
```
**Purpose:** Calculates the total number of goals scored in a match by both teams.
- `G1`: Home team goals
- `G2`: Away team goals
- **Use Case:** Analysis of goal-scoring patterns and over/under betting market accuracy

### TotalXg - Total Expected Goals in Match
```dax
TotalXg = '14-20'[xG1] + '14-20'[xG2]
```
**Purpose:** Calculates the total expected goals (xG) for both teams in a match.
- `xG1`: Home team expected goals
- `xG2`: Away team expected goals
- **Use Case:** Comparing actual goals vs expected goals to identify overperformance/underperformance

## Bookmaker Probability Calculations

### %>2.5 - Probability of Over 2.5 Goals
```dax
%>2.5 = (100/('14-20'[>2,5]/0.95))/100
```
**Purpose:** Converts bookmaker odds to implied probability for over 2.5 goals market.
- Takes bookmaker average odds for over 2.5 goals
- Removes 5% bookmaker margin (0.95 factor)
- Converts to percentage probability
- **Formula Logic:** `Probability = 1 / (Odds / Margin Adjustment)`

### %<2.5 - Probability of Under 2.5 Goals
```dax
%<2.5 = (100/('14-20'[<2,5]/0.95))/100
```
**Purpose:** Converts bookmaker odds to implied probability for under 2.5 goals market.
- Same logic as %>2.5 but for under 2.5 goals
- **Use Case:** Analyzing bookmaker accuracy in total goals predictions

### %W1 - Home Win Probability
```dax
%W1 = (100/('14-20'[W1]/0.95))/100
```
**Purpose:** Converts home win odds to implied probability.
- `W1`: Average bookmaker odds for home win
- **Use Case:** Comparing predicted vs actual home win rates

### %D - Draw Probability
```dax
%D = (100/('14-20'[D]/0.95))/100
```
**Purpose:** Converts draw odds to implied probability.
- `D`: Average bookmaker odds for draw
- **Use Case:** Analyzing draw prediction accuracy

### %W2 - Away Win Probability
```dax
%W2 = (100/('14-20'[W2]/0.95))/100
```
**Purpose:** Converts away win odds to implied probability.
- `W2`: Average bookmaker odds for away win
- **Use Case:** Comparing predicted vs actual away win rates

## Betting Accuracy Indicators

### OddG - Goals Betting Accuracy (Actual)
```dax
OddG = IF(
    '14-20'[TotalG] > 2.5,
    IF(
        '14-20'[%>2.5] > 49.9/100,
        1,
        0
    ),
    IF(
        '14-20'[%<2.5] > 49.9/100,
        1,
        0
    )
)
```
**Purpose:** Determines if bookmakers correctly predicted the over/under 2.5 goals outcome.
- **Logic:** 
  - If actual goals > 2.5 AND bookmaker probability for over 2.5 > 49.9%, then correct (1)
  - If actual goals â‰¤ 2.5 AND bookmaker probability for under 2.5 > 49.9%, then correct (1)
  - Otherwise incorrect (0)
- **Use Case:** Measuring bookmaker accuracy in goals markets

### OddXg - Goals Betting Accuracy (Expected)
```dax
OddXg = IF(
    '14-20'[TotalXg] > 2.5,
    IF(
        '14-20'[%>2.5] > 49.9/100,
        1,
        0
    ),
    IF(
        '14-20'[%<2.5] > 49.9/100,
        1,
        0
    )
)
```
**Purpose:** Same as OddG but uses expected goals instead of actual goals.
- **Use Case:** Comparing bookmaker predictions against xG-based expectations

### OddW - Match Result Betting Accuracy (Actual)
```dax
OddW = IF(
    '14-20'[G1] > '14-20'[G2],
    IF(
        '14-20'[%W1] > '14-20'[%W2],

    IF(
        '14-20'[%W2] > '14-20'[%W1],
        1,
        0
    )
)
```
**Purpose:** Determines if bookmakers correctly predicted the match winner based on actual results.
- **Logic:** Compares actual winner with bookmaker favorite (higher probability)
- **Note:** Does not account for draws
- **Use Case:** Measuring bookmaker accuracy in match result predictions

### OddWXg - Match Result Betting Accuracy (Expected)
```dax
OddWXg = IF(
    '14-20'[xG1] > '14-20'[xG2],
    IF(
        '14-20'[%W1] > '14-20'[%W2],
        1,
        0
    ),
    IF(
        '14-20'[%W2] > '14-20'[%W1],
        1,
        0
    )
)
```
**Purpose:** Same as OddW but uses expected goals to determine the "deserved" winner.
- **Use Case:** Analyzing if bookmaker predictions align with underlying performance metrics

## Performance Differential Metrics

### Xg_Dif1 - Home Team Goal vs xG Difference
```dax
Xg_Dif1 = '14-20'[G1] - '14-20'[xG1]
```
**Purpose:** Measures how much the home team outperformed or underperformed their expected goals.
- **Positive values:** Team scored more than expected (clinical finishing)
- **Negative values:** Team scored less than expected (poor finishing)

### Xg_Dif2 - Away Team Goal vs xG Difference
```dax
Xg_Dif2 = '14-20'[G2] - '14-20'[xG2]
```

## Unpredictability Indices

### Unpredictability_Xg_Index - xG vs Bookmaker Predictions
```dax
Unpredictability_Xg_Index = 
VAR H = IF('14-20'[xG1] > '14-20'[xG2], 1, 0)
VAR A = IF('14-20'[xG1] < '14-20'[xG2], 1, 0)
VAR pH = '14-20'[%W1]
VAR pA = '14-20'[%W2]
VAR D = 0
VAR pD = '14-20'[%D]
RETURN (H - pH)^2 + (D - pD)^2 + (A - pA)^2
```
**Purpose:** Measures how much the xG-predicted outcome differs from bookmaker predictions.
- **Formula:** Sum of squared differences between xG-based predictions and bookmaker probabilities
- **Higher values:** Greater disagreement between xG and betting markets
- **Use Case:** Identifying matches where performance metrics disagree with market expectations

### Unpredictability_Index - Actual vs Bookmaker Predictions
```dax
Unpredictability_Index = 
VAR H = IF('14-20'[R] = "H", 1, 0)
VAR D = IF('14-20'[R] = "D", 1, 0)
VAR A = IF('14-20'[R] = "A", 1, 0)
VAR pH = '14-20'[%W1]
VAR pD = '14-20'[%D]
VAR pA = '14-20'[%W2]
RETURN (H - pH)^2 + (D - pD)^2 + (A - pA)^2
```
**Purpose:** Measures how unpredictable the actual match result was compared to bookmaker expectations.
- **Higher values:** More surprising results (upsets)
- **Use Case:** Identifying the most unpredictable matches and analyzing upset patterns

### Unpredictability_Xg2_Index - Modified xG vs Bookmaker Predictions
```dax
Unpredictability_Xg2_Index = 
VAR H = IF('14-20'[xG1]-0.5 > '14-20'[xG2], 1, 0)
VAR A = IF('14-20'[xG1] < '14-20'[xG2]-0.5, 1, 0)
VAR pH = '14-20'[%W1]
VAR pA = '14-20'[%W2]
VAR D = IF('14-20'[xG1]-0.5 < '14-20'[xG2] && '14-20'[xG1] > '14-20'[xG2]-0.5, 1, 0)
VAR pD = '14-20'[%D]
RETURN (H - pH)^2 + (D - pD)^2 + (A - pA)^2
```
**Purpose:** Modified version of xG unpredictability with 0.5 goal buffer for draws.
- **Logic:** Requires 0.5+ xG difference to predict a winner, otherwise predicts draw
- **Use Case:** More conservative xG-based predictions that account for small xG differences

    '14-20'[G2] - '14-20'[G1]
)
```
**Purpose:** Calculates the absolute goal difference in each match.
- **Values:** 0 (draw), 1 (one-goal difference), 2+ (multi-goal difference)
- **Use Case:** Analyzing match competitiveness and margin of victory patterns

### Xg_Diff_In_Match - Expected Goal Difference Magnitude
```dax
Xg_Diff_In_Match = MROUND(
    IF('14-20'[xG1] > '14-20'[xG2], 
       '14-20'[xG1] - '14-20'[xG2], 
       '14-20'[xG2] - '14-20'[xG1]),
    0.5
)
```
**Purpose:** Calculates the absolute xG difference in each match, rounded to nearest 0.5.
- **MROUND function:** Rounds to nearest 0.5 for easier categorization
- **Use Case:** Comparing actual goal differences with expected goal differences to identify close vs dominant performances

## Usage Notes

### Data Source
All formulas reference the `'14-20'` table containing integrated football data from 2014-2020 seasons.

### Key Assumptions
- **Bookmaker Margin:** 5% margin removed from odds (0.95 factor)
- **Probability Threshold:** 49.9% used as decision boundary for betting accuracy
- **xG Interpretation:** Higher xG indicates better attacking performance

### Recommended Applications
1. **Betting Market Analysis:** Use OddG, OddW, OddXg, OddWXg for accuracy studies
2. **Team Performance:** Use Xg_Dif metrics and Win indicators for team analysis
3. **Match Unpredictability:** Use Unpredictability indices for upset identification
4. **Market Efficiency:** Compare actual outcomes with xG predictions and bookmaker odds

### Power BI Implementation
These formulas are designed as calculated columns in Power BI and can be used in:
- **Visualizations:** Charts, tables, and cards
